	<div id='statement'> The multiple integral is a generalization of the definite integral to functions of more than one real variable. Integrals of a function of two variables over a region in R2 are called double integrals, and integrals of a function of three variables over a region of R3 are called triple integrals. Just as the definite integral of a positive function of one variable represents the area of the region between the graph of the function and the x-axis, the double integral of a positive function of two variables represents the volume of the region between the surface defined by the function and the plane which contains its domain. If there are more variables, a multiple integral will yield hypervolumes of multi-dimensional functions.

	<div id='morestate'> More Background </div>
	<div id='morestatement'> Multiple integration of a function in n variables over a domain D is most commonly represented by nested integral signs in the reverse order of execution (the leftmost integral sign is computed last), followed by the function and integrand arguments in proper order (the integral with respect to the rightmost argument is computed last). The domain of integration is either represented symbolically for every argument over each integral sign, or is abbreviated by a variable at the rightmost integral sign. Since the concept of an antiderivative is only defined for functions of a single real variable, the usual definition of the indefinite integral does not immediately extend to the multiple integral.

	<div id='answers'> First, draw out the axes for the region described and draw the plane. Then draw the projection of the plane onto two of the three axes. From there, you find that the equation for the line that creates the x-y projection. Now establish your bounds, the first from 0 to the equation, then from 0 to 3 (if you integrate y, then x). Then you integrate over y, substituting the equation in for y. Then you integrate for x, substituting in your scalar bounds. This gives you a volume for the tetrahedron of 3*sqrt(14).
